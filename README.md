This repository contains files and examples developed during my introductory training for Silvaco TCAD software. Silvaco is a specialized tool for simulating semiconductor processes and devices, widely used in industry and research to model phenomena such as thermal oxidation, dopant diffusion, MOS structure formation, and more.

This repository contains files and examples developed during my introductory training in Analog and Digital Integrated Circuit (IC) design using Electro Tlalli, an open source EDA suite tailored for educational and research purposes. The design flow is based on the SKY130 PDK (Process Design Kit), an open source 130nm process developed by SkyWater Technology. Electro Tlalli integrates tools like Xschem for schematic capture, Ngspice for simulation, Magic VLSI for layout editing, Netgen for LVS, and OpenLane for digital synthesis and physical design. Through this environment, I explored the full IC design cycle‚Äîfrom transistor-level analog design to RTL-to-GDSII digital flow‚Äîgaining hands-on experience in design rule checking (DRC), layout versus schematic (LVS) verification, parasitic extraction, and tape-out preparation. This repository serves as a record of my learning journey and a reference for future open silicon development.
